so i noticed that after the work space is made the build folder had little to no code
on the mob renders and a bunch more that i probably dont know yet.
but a tutorial for 1.7.2 had said documentation and i tested the code for the 
renderer and as far as i tested it seems to be a 1:1 when it comes to compatability
so knowing this i added it to the list of files.

after the gradle is made and the work space is set up un pack this compessed file so the folder is
in the work space with all the other main files

then in eclipse you should be able to use the built in code
idk why the src for 1.7.10 is missing it. could just be located in a different place
idk tbh but now just in case you have access like how 1.7.2 did it.



just put it in the main folder nothing fancy
